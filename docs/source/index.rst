What is *fusion-tools*?
---------------

*fusion-tools* was designed as a flexible way for users to generate
interactive components which focus on **histological images**. It was 
designed in tandem with *FUSION (Functional Units State Identification in WSIs)*,
which focused on paired analysis of **spatial --omics** data. *fusion-tools* provides
an easy-to-use (hopefully) interface for users to instantiate their own versions of *FUSION*
with incorporation of locally stored data, develop their own interactive components, and 
design their own upload templates for new varieties of spatial data or new cloud-hosted
plugins.
